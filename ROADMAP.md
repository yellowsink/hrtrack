## Done
 - user id + access key authentication
 - encrypted storage helper apis
 - account creation flow
 - login and logout apis
 - session expiration

## In Progress
 - full API documentation for my own reference
 - full database format and entity documentation (again for my reference)

## To-Do (high priority)
 - frontend (develop this in sync with the server, not afterwards)
 - fully mock up stored data and UI
 - actually store medicate events
   * multiple medication types from the start
 - store and auto update current stocks
 - account deletion and export (both of these require recursively finding the user's owned objects)

## To-Do (later)
 - stats and trends
 - bloodwork support
 - push notifications
 - milestones
 - injection site suggestion
 - rewrite sessions to be encrypted
 - body measurements
 - data import (useful for migrating instances, should only be possible at account creation time)

## unsure if will include or not (feels like scope creep)
 - journaling (just use monica or equivalent?)
 - period tracking capabilities (just use Euki?)
 - storing selfies etc over time (idk have a folder or something)
